# Plan

## Goal
Make `Datasetdokumentation/` usable immediately after clone with clear setup/run instructions and no hidden global dependencies.

## Steps
1. Add missing JS build dependency declarations.
2. Update onboarding docs with exact clone-to-run commands.
3. Remove misleading/broken references and generated empty artifact.
4. Align ignore rules with reproducible dependency management.
5. Verify key commands still run.
